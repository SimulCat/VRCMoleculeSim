# VRCMoleculeSim
Library for UdonSharp Modules in VRChat molecule simulations
This project is a preliminary attempt at getting a viable VRChat simulation that demonstrates 
a remarkable model of quantum scattering based on ideas primarily derived from the 
work of Carolyne Van Vliet (1967 & 2010), and William Duane (1923).

In order to get this able to run on the Oculus Quest 2, and within the limitations of the VRChat
development environment (Udon#), this first attempt uses particle system code and does not make 
use of compute shaders.
